ultimate-java
=========

A fun personal project to port Ultima 4 port using LIBGDX, with a few extra story lines added in, 
and an auto-journal feature to make it easier to keep track of conversations.

Some of the game engine algorithms were ported from the XU4 project on sourceforge.
http://xu4.sourceforge.net/.

The "Virtue of Humility" bonus story was ported from a previous project.
The Devil's Guard and Delve of Sorrows areas are original content.

Most of the graphics and sounds are also borrowed from other sources such as xu4 and Spectromancer.

Download binary here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84215797/ultimate-java-1.0.1-bin.zip
To run this, you will need to install java first (if not already installed), and then extract 
the binary zip archive and double click on the main jar file.  
The save game file (PARTY.SAV) is compatible with the original as well.
