Ultima 4
=========

A fun personal project to port Ultima 4 port using LIBGDX, with a few extra story lines added in, 
and an auto-journal feature to make it easier to keep track of conversations.

Some of the game engine algorithms were ported from the XU4 project on sourceforge.
http://xu4.sourceforge.net/.

The "Virtue of Humility" bonus story was ported from a previous project.
The Devil's Guard and Delve of Sorrows areas are original content.

Most of the graphics and sounds are also borrowed from other sources such as xu4 and Spectromancer.
